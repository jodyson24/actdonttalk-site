                    <h2>About Us</h2>

                    <p>
                        Act Don't Talk is a community of changemakers
                        birthed by the harsh realities of the Covid-19
                        pandemic.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Rooted in the spirit of positive social revolutions, we
                        position our efforts to help the bottom of the totem
                        pole - the society's indigent, especially the sick and
                        children.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We have created several initiatives, such as Free
                        Online/Offline Schooling for Underprivileged
                        Children, Sponsoring Medical Procedures for
                        indigent people and many others.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We believe strongly in hard work and we are poised
                        to truly care for the people who are less cared for.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We are comprised of a team of dedicated
                        individuals who have volunteered their time and
                        resources to achieving our goal of reducing
                        poverty-induced suffering and improving access to
                        education for underprivileged children.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Act Don't Talk is a community of thinkers, dreamers,
                        go-getters, leaders, carers and lovers. We believe
                        that we can create sustainable development and
                        put smiles on faces that have known mostly pain.

                    After three months of providing succour to over
                    200 families during the lockdown occasioned by COVID 19 pandemic.
                </p>

                    Our scope and vision has been enlarged by God and
                    we are taking our action based solutions to another level.

                            <p>
                                Here, we intend to improve the business of some Act Don't Talk Volunteers.
                                We intend to raise grant and take selected volunteers through a
                                entrepreneurial training system. After which, the grants will be used to
                                improve their business, especially for those with skills; like Beauty services,
                                Fashion , Catering, Graphics and ICT among others. After these volunteers
                                have been empowered, ADT will get young boys and girls who are from
                                indigent homes, and enrol them with these volunteers, for skills training. After
                                the successful completion of training, these young boys and girls will also be
                                taken through an entrepreneurial training, grants raised for them to start up,
                                and they also will in turn train new set of young people. Thereby creating a
                                continuous cycle of empowerment.

                            <p>
                                This project will acquire farm lands in different parts of the country for
                                Agriculture purpose; both Crop and Livestock. We will get unemployed and
                                out of school young people to work on the farm in the morning, while they
                                learn formal education in the evening. Skills acquisition will be added to this
                                too. After harvest and sales; a portion of the profits from the farm will be
                                shared among the young people who have worked on these farms. This
                                project will help to keep the young, unemployed and uneducated Nigerians
                                off the street especially after the pandemic; when many may have lost jobs,
                                or the opportunity to return to school.
